# jupyter-notebook-road-fatalities
data analysis project with jupyter notebook and python

## Background
I conducted this project as part of the nanodegree "Intro to Programming".<br>
It mainly uses the libraries pandas and numpy.<br>
This notebook is written for the python version 2.7.15

### Request for improvement
I would like to improve the axis label of the first line chart **Average number of car deaths between 1999 and 2008** (remove the brackets and add ticks for every year).<br><br>
On 2019-02-18, I removed the brackets from the x label. But I still would like to add a tick for every year.
